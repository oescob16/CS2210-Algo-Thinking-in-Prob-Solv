The problem:

1. Define the problem/solution recursively
2. Briefly talk about how you plan to store solutions to sub-problems and combining them to solve the global problem
3. Talk about how you used IDEAL and Duke 7 to tackle the problem

IDEAL:
 I: The problem is asking to find how many arithmetic sequences are is in an array A.
 D: The goal is to return an integer representing the total amount of valid arithmetic sequences and to avoid repeated computation.
 E: Given the input [1,2,3,4] I tried to find all possible arithmetic sequences in there, then I tried to find the relation between the smallest problem to the biggest one.
 A: I tried to come up with other inputs to trace it and check if tracing result gave me the expected output.
 L: Once I solved the problem I realized that even though I know many stuff about programming there are a lot many techniques to learn, I have to improve in DFS, BFS, and DP.
 
 Duke 7 Steps:
 1. I used the given input and output.
 2. I traced how the problem is going to behave (pattern) with the input to give us the output.
 3. I noticed that once we go to other column there is unnecesary computation (repeated work).
 4. I traced (OneNote) my attempted solution (pseudo-code) to see if it would work with the given input.
 5. I translated succesfully my code.
 6. I ran other scenario that I traced to check if it gave me the desired output.
 7. I rename some variables, remove unnecesary lines, I applied some one-liners, and use libraries.
